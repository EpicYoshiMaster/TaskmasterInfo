description="Do you have an obsession with playing the best level in the game, Ship Shape? Are you interested in learning just how much complexity lies at the core of this incredible, perfect, amazing level??? Of course you do!!![br][br][br]The Taskmaster Information Overlay provides hidden information about the Taskmaster to help you plan and learn to play Ship Shape and Cruisin' for a Bruisin' on a higher level.[br][br][br]This is a tool primarily intended to help speedrunners and those curious about the innerworkings of this needlessly complicated (albeit appreciably) mission.[br][br][br]Note: This mod directly replaces the original Taskmaster with a custom version in order to control the inner workings and display otherwise hidden information to the player. Don't expect this mod to be compatible with other mods that do this sort of thing![br][br][br]Enjoy!!"
