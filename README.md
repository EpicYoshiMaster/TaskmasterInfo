# Taskmaster Information Overlay
A Hat in Time Mod for displaying information about Ship Shape's Taskmaster.

The Taskmaster Information Overlay provides hidden information about the Taskmaster to help you plan and learn to play Ship Shape and Cruisin' for a Bruisin' on a higher level.


This is a tool primarily intended to help speedrunners and those curious about the innerworkings of this needlessly complicated (albeit appreciably) mission.
